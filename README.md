This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: an off-by-one error that results in a Constraint_Error exception.  The `bug.ada` file contains code that attempts to access an array element outside its defined bounds. The `bugSolution.ada` file shows the corrected code. Ada's strong typing and range checks are beneficial but require careful attention to detail when working with arrays and loops.
